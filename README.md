![Premier League Logo](https://mysportsmovement.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Premier-league-18-19-season-800x360.jpg)

Predict the outcomes of Premier League matches (home win, draw, away win) using machine learning with a Random Forest classifier. This project leverages historical data and feature engineering techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Key Features
- ‚öΩ Predict Premier League match outcomes with machine learning
- üìä Engineered features like HomePPG, AwayPPG, and Form data for more accurate predictions
- üå≤ Built and optimized using Random Forest classifier
- üîç Performance evaluated with confusion matrix and feature importance analysis
- üìà Achieved 60% accuracy on unseen test data

## Understanding the Dataset and Extracting Insights üîç

To better analyze and understand the dataset, I visualized a cumulative points table for all 20 Premier League teams throughout the 2018-2019 season. üìä This visualization allowed us to track each team's total points on a weekly basis, providing clear insights into how their performance evolved over the season. It also highlighted performance differences between the teams, making it easier to identify trends and outliers. üöÄ

  ## Model Performance

Below is the confusion matrix for the Random Forest model, showcasing how the model performed in predicting match outcomes:

## Feature Importance

To understand which features had the most influence on the model's predictions, feature importance scores were calculated and visualized. This analysis revealed that **HomePPG** and **AwayPPG** played the most significant roles in determining the outcomes.
